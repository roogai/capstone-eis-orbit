# 📌 Capstone EIS-Orbit

**Enterprise Information System Orbit**  
Capstone project for Imperial College London’s Professional Certificate in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Overview

EIS-Orbit is a modular decision intelligence engine built to simulate, optimize, and evaluate trade execution workflows using ML-driven probability logic. It mimics OMS behavior in asset management environments, supporting routing, risk modeling, and strategic alignment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Model venue routing and execution pathways using probability-based decision logic  
- Embed supervised learning layers to prioritize venue selections based on historical trade data  
- Prototype OMS-inspired strategy nodes for risk-adjusted portfolio shifts  
- Develop scalable modules for EIS integration into fintech workflows

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib / Plotly for simulation visualizations
- Jupyter Notebooks for iterative testing
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Custom simulation environment mimicking real-world trading constraints
